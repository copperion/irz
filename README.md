# IRZ
Control my dormitory's air conditioner with RaspberryPi and IR sender.

The aircon is an unknown type from Haier. May not be able to apply to your aircon.

For details on this project, please visit [this post on my blog](https://www.lonelyion.com/2019/control-aircon-with-web-and-raspberrypi/) (Chinese only).

I will probably not update this project in the future. Using smart IoT devices like [Xiaomi Mijia AC Controller](https://www.mi.com/ac-controller) is much better if you want to control your air conditioner remotely. This is just a practice project which leads me to learn full-stack development.

# Todo
+ <del>Send IR commands with program parameters.</del> done
+ <del>Add web interface to control remotely.</del>Almost done
